# I WILL LEARN JAVA WITH SPRING IN 90 DAYS YALL SEE

### Starting point

Basically i decided to learn about backend applications for once, and spring framework was the first to pop on my head

This repo is for now a RESTful API created using Spring and some other dependencies like maven, h2, jpa, bean validation(in the near future), etc.....


### **Now may I ask you, to watch me cook**

### 30 days mark
Its been past 30 days already, and honestly, I'm pretty satisfied in how far I've progressed, I could take Java job offers already at this point.

We've dealt with error handling, security measures, validation, database accessibility, etc.
It's a pretty basic API still but it's taking some form.
