# I WILL LEARN JAVA WITH SPRING IN 30 DAYS YALL SEE

### Starting point

Basically i decided to learn about backend applications for once, and spring framework was the first to pop on my head

This repo is for now a RESTful API created using Spring and some other dependencies like maven, h2, jpa, bean validation(in the near future), etc.....

Its been past 30 days already, and honestly, I'm pretty satisfied in how far I've progressed, can't say I dominated the language, but I could take Java job offers at this point.
